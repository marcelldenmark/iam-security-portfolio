# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Access Review Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that user access to enterprise systems is reviewed on a regular basis to enforce least privilege, reduce unauthorized access, and support compliance with internal security standards and regulatory requirements.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties with access to enterprise systems, including but not limited to:
- Active Directory
- VPN and remote access platforms
- HR and financial systems
- Internal applications and shared resources

## Access Review Frequency
Access reviews must be conducted at the following intervals:
- **Quarterly** for privileged or administrative access
- **Semi-annually** for standard user access
- **Immediately** following role changes (Mover events)
- **Immediately** upon employee termination (Leaver events)

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Managers**
  - Review and certify access for users within their teams
  - Validate that access aligns with job responsibilities
- **IAM / IT Security**
  - Facilitate access reviews and provide review artifacts
  - Remove or modify access that is no longer required
  - Maintain documentation for audit purposes
- **HR**
  - Notify IAM/IT of Joiner, Mover, and Leaver events in a timely manner

## Review Process
1. IAM generates an access review report for in-scope systems
2. Managers review user access and identify inappropriate permissions
3. Findings are documented and tracked
4. IAM removes or adjusts access based on approved decisions
5. Completion is recorded for audit and compliance validation

## Non-Compliance
Failure to complete access reviews within the required timeframe may result in:
- Increased security risk
- Audit findings
- Escalation to senior management

## Policy Review
This policy must be reviewed annually by the IAM and Security teams to ensure continued effectiveness and alignment with organizational requirements.
