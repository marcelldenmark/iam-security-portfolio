# IAM / Security Operations Portfolio — Marcell Denmark

This repository contains practical work samples focused on Identity & Access Management (IAM) and security operations within enterprise, compliance-driven environments. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I approach access governance, incident documentation, and operational security support using real-world IAM workflows rather than academic exercises.

My background includes enterprise IT and security support (Active Directory, MFA, access troubleshooting), a Security Automation internship with SAP, and DevSecOps exposure through a federal-aligned internship with NIWC Pacific. The artifacts in this repository reflect common IAM responsibilities such as access reviews, Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML) processes, and audit-ready documentation used by security operations teams.

All examples are sanitized and designed to function as reusable operational templates. This portfolio will continue to expand with additional IAM governance materials, least-privilege reviews, and lightweight automation supporting access visibility and control evidence collection.
